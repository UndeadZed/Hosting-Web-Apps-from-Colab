# Hosting-Web-Apps-on-Google-Colab
Using Node JS in Colab Notebooks to deploy different kinds of web apps temporarily for debugging and testing Purposes

# Motivation

I wanted an easy way to test AI powered webapps before deployment without upgrading my hardware or using expensive cloud services

# Requirements

All of the currently available examples are basic examples so no requirements other than having internet connection are required

# How to Use



# Credits

Big credit to [FahimFBA](https://github.com/FahimFBA) whom we used his project in one of the examples


# Limitations
No Google drive linked examples are made yet since all the current examples are just basic examples

# What's new
Simple Python Django implementation example notebook in Colab

# Future updates

I will be focusing on adding usable example which use different front and backend technologies to make AI powered APPs

# Notes
feel free to contribute to this repo and add additional examples
